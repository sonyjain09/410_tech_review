IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding is an API that offers a variety of tools related to natural language processing (NLP). These tools assist users in analyzing unstructured text data to gain insight on different attributes of the text. This technical review
evaluates the API in terms of its main functionalities: sentiment analysis, entity extraction, keyword tagging, speed and scalability and multilingual support. We will assess and compare its ease of integration and performance with other prominent NLP tools. By 
testing the API with real-world datasets and applications, we hope to make sense of its strengths and limitations.
